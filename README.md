## Task Management

Very simple Laravel web application for task management.

- Project CRUD.
- Task CRUD & assign to a project.
- Filter Tasks by Project.
- Change priority of task by drag & drop.


### Setup or Deployment

- Unzip taskmanagement.zip file.
- Open .env file & change DB settings (DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD) or keep it & create database & user as per .env file settings.
- Open terminal & go to the project directory. 
- Now run migration by `php artisan migrate`.
- The project is ready to run. Run it by `php artisan serve` & use the url in the browser.
- Initially there is no data. First need to add project, before task creation.
